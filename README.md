# Re-former

An app which allows the user to input and save his/her username, email address and password.

This project was an exercise in the building of forms, from HTML to using the helper methods that Rails provides (#form_tag and #form_with). The Rails way sends parameters to a controller which builds an instance of a model with those parameters for the view.
