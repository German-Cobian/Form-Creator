# Re-former

An app which allows the user to input and save his/her username, email address and password.

This project was an exercise in the building of forms, from HTML to using the helper methods that Rails provides (#form_tag and #form_with). The Rails way sends parameters to a controller which builds an instance of a model with those parameters for the view.

* Navigate to the project's directory using the cd command
* Execute rails server to fire up the server
* Visit http://localhost:3000/users/new to see the form on your browser
* The edit page handles editing an existing user. The page is found by visiting http://localhost:3000/users/1
* To close the server, enter Ctrl + C in your terminal

### Usage

The front end ( http://localhost:3000/users/new ) displays a form which allows a user to input their username, email and password. The back end shows the server output and/or any errors stack trace. None of the input fields can be blank on the edit page: http://localhost:3000/users/1. On the edit page, if a user tries submitting a form that fails the validations, a list of error messages attached to the failed model is displayed.
